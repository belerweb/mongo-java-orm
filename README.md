mongo-java-orm
========

A copy of http://code.google.com/p/mongo-java-orm/, then deploy it to maven central repository.

I tried to make few contribution on http://code.google.com/p/mongo-java-orm/ to deploy mongo-java-orm to central maven repository, but everything not going smooth. I really don't like private repositoy, so I dump codes, put project on github, deploy artifact to central maven repository. I am look forward to the original author migrate project to github, and we can find a way to cooperate. 

I will maintain minor version(such as 1.2.1) on github, but dump major version from http://code.google.com/p/mongo-java-orm/.

Please feel free to contribute issues, codes, documents ...
